## System Architecture: A Scalable Client-Server Model

### SensAi Client-Server Architecture

The SensAi platform is built on a modern, client-server architecture designed for scalability and performance. The front end is a Next.js application that communicates with a serverless backend, which in turn interacts with a PostgreSQL database and various third-party services.

### Architectural Breakdown

#### **Client (The Frontend)**

The client-side is a responsive and interactive user interface built with **React** and **Next.js**. It features a rich set of UI components from **Shadcn UI** and is styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The client is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.

#### **Server (The Backend)**

The backend is built using **Next.js API Routes** and **Server Actions**, providing a robust and scalable serverless architecture. It handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database and external services.

#### **Communication Protocol**

The client and server communicate via HTTP requests. The front end sends requests to the backend to fetch data, generate content, and perform other actions. The backend processes these requests, interacts with the database and external services, and returns the results to the client.

## Feature-Driven DSA Implementation: A Technical Analysis

The SensAi platform leverages a variety of data structures and algorithms to deliver its intelligent features:

  * **Resume Builder**: The resume builder uses a form-based editor and a Markdown editor to create and manage resumes. The data is stored in a structured format in the database and can be easily converted to a PDF for download.
  * **Cover Letter Generator**: The cover letter generator uses the Gemini API to generate tailored cover letters based on user-provided job descriptions. The generated letters are stored in the database and can be viewed and managed by the user.
  * **Interview Preparation**: The interview preparation system uses the Gemini API to generate mock interview questions tailored to the user's industry and skills. The user's performance is tracked over time with detailed analytics, which are displayed in interactive charts.
